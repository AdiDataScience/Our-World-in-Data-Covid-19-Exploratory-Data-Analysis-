Objective: To analyse the trends of daily new cases, new deaths, vaccination status for Covid-19 in UK and India using ‘Our world in Data Covid-19’ dataset and prediction of new deaths in UK.
Methods: The data has been confined to a specific time-frame (wave 1 and wave 2 of covid 19 pandemic) for UK and India to analyse the trends following all the data analysis processes (data collection, data pre-processing, data transformation and data visualization) and data modelling using multiple regression.
Results: The total cases in India are almost thrice the number in the UK during both the waves. The total number of deaths in India are four times the number in the UK during both the waves. 14952313 people in the United Kingdom and 147797142 people in India have been completely vaccinated with two doses.
Conclusions: There is a significant number of cases in India as the first wave in India lasted longer than expected. Emergence of new variants like Delta and Alpha resulted in an increase in the number of fatalities. Vaccination has proved to be efficient in lowering down the death rate.
